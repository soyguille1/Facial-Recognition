Use Open CV to manage the name, date, and time of a facial AI program. If you have an educational institution or university and want to control the check-in and check-out time, you can adapt it to your own way and train it.
PS: If you want to try it, you need to create a folder called "Personal" and add the photos you want to save to the database in a csv.
